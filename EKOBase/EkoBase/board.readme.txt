2 Layer board, Included top/bottom : copper layers, solder mask, silkscreen
Also included are the drill files.

board outline is in the Board Outline gerber file.

There are 2 DRC issues on the bottom right of the board on the SD Card Holder mounting pads. These are shape/component clearance issues and they hopefully should not affect you. In any case, those pads are for mounting and thus not critical.

No dimension accuracy required.

A previous version of this design was manufactured by PCBTrain about 2 months ago. Same board name: EKOBase.

Included is the RS Design Spark PCB file. Also included (if needed) are the Design Spark schematics / Circuit PDF.

All holes PTH

Thank You Very Much!
