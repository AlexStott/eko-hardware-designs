Energy Kiosk Observer Hardware Schematics
=========================================

This project includes hardware schematics for the Energy Kiosk Observer datalogging system for e.quinox (www.e.quinox.org).

Cadsoft EAGLE is the tool of choice when designing PCBs, although some designs are being moved to RS DesignSpark.
